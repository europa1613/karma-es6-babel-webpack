# Karma unit testing ES6 javascript with Webpack, babel #

This code is from this blog posting
http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/writing-jasmine-unit-tests-in-es6

Since code in the posting is outdated, I updated the codes to work with the latest babel modules.

## Building and running test ##

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zirho/karma-es6-babel-webpack
cd karma-es6-babel-webpack
npm i
npm i -g karma-cli

npm run tests
```
